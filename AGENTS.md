<!--
  Written 2026-09-18 by prompt-lab's make-agents-md.sh, for Nico. The prompt-lab agent
  owns this format; raise questions in that repo's handoff channel.

  Why this is a pointer and not a copy: CLAUDE.md is this repo's single source of
  project instructions. Codex reads AGENTS.md automatically, so this file sends it
  to CLAUDE.md and carries the shared-conventions block below.

  Do not replace it with a copy of CLAUDE.md. In September 2026, Codex Desktop's
  "import from Claude Code" wrote whole-file copies using a blind Claude-to-Codex
  find-replace that broke real paths (~/.claude became ~/.Codex), and the copies
  drifted. The importer only writes AGENTS.md where none exists, so keeping this
  file in place also stops those copies from coming back.

  Codex-only notes can go above the markers. Refresh the block with:
  ~/.claude/bin/sync-shared-md.sh --apply ./AGENTS.md
-->

Read CLAUDE.md in this repo first for project-specific conventions.

## Shared conventions

<!-- These are Nico's cross-repo output rules. They're materialized into each repo's
CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md so every agent (local, cloud, third-party) sees them as plain
text. Source of truth: prompt-lab/workflow/claude-md-shared.md — edit there and
re-sync, never here. -->

- **Clickable URLs.** When pointing at any web destination (dashboard, repo, PR, deploy, settings, docs, localhost), print the full bare URL — `https://example.com` or `http://localhost:8080` — on its own, never just the page's name and never a markdown `[label](url)` link. Nico's terminal auto-linkifies raw `https://` text, so a bare URL is one-click and stays copyable.

- **Number your questions.** Any time you ask Nico more than one question, present them as a numbered list (1., 2., 3.) so he can answer by number with no ambiguity. A single standalone question needs no number.

- **Self-contained smoke-test instructions.** When you ask Nico to manually test or verify an app or website, assume zero carried-over context — he should never scroll back or recall a URL/path/credential from earlier. Always include: the exact URL (full `https://…` or `http://localhost:…`, restated even if mentioned above), the precise steps in order, and what a pass vs. fail looks like. Repetition here is a feature, not clutter.

- **UTC at rest, Pacific on display.** Timestamps are stored in UTC, always. A *calendar day* shown to a human is `America/Los_Angeles` — Nico's day, and the clock the work actually happened on. The two rules that follow are the ones that get broken: never form a date bucket with `new Date(…).toISOString().slice(0,10)` (that is UTC, so every chart axis and "today" silently rolls over at 5pm Pacific — it put a phantom tomorrow bar on the Prompt Lab dashboard), and never bucket UTC-stamped rows with a bare `date(col)` in SQL. Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-CA', { timeZone: 'America/Los_Angeles' })` in JS and an explicit zone in SQL/Python. Storage in local time is also wrong — it can't be migrated across a DST boundary without loss.

- **No marker before a copy-paste command block.** Nico's terminal renders markdown bullets (`-`, `*`, `•`) as `●`, which breaks paste into zsh. The line directly above a fenced command block must be a plain-text label ending in a colon — never a bullet, dash, asterisk, or number. For loud copy targets, lead the label with `📋` + bold `COPY THE BELOW`, then a colon, then the block.

- **Codex branches are named `codex/<description>`.** When working in this repo via Codex CLI, always create a working branch under the `codex/` prefix (e.g. `codex/fix-flaky-test`) rather than working directly on `main` or an unprefixed branch. Claude Code has no visibility into other tools' running sessions (`ListAgents` only sees Claude sessions), so this prefix is the one signal a Claude session can check for — a local or remote `codex/*` branch means Codex has touched or is touching this repo, even though its session itself is invisible. Claude branches keep whatever naming they already use; only Codex adopts this new prefix.
